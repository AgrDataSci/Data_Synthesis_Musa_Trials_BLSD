For preliminary analysis, some missing points have been filled using data from IMTP-2 report and
also looking for the research station address in Google and Google EARTH.

IMTP-3 trial 16174 does not contain data for bunch weight, therefore it was not included in the analysis.

IMTP-3 trial 16175 differ in column names and table format, it was coerced to the rest of trials.

Some trials have data for first cycle only and other have for second cycle (mother and ratoon).
